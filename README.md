- I made this project using the GitHub API to scrape user data from Boston profiles. The key steps involved, API authentication, User search , Data Retrieval, Data Cleaning and finally exporting it into a CSV file.
-The most interesting fact I discovered was that, contrary to popular belief, the number of followers tends to increase only slightly. The negative regression slope suggests that other factors influence follower count beyond just the number of repositories.
-Based on my analysis, I recommend developers focus more on user engagement strategies. They should prioritize content quality over quantity and consider collaborative projects, as these will likely lead to increased visibility and interaction.
